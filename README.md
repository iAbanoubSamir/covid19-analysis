# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

A comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 global data using Python, Pandas, and MySQL to uncover insights about the pandemic's spread and impact across different regions.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to understand patterns, trends, and impacts across different countries and regions. We focus on key metrics like case numbers, mortality rates, and regional distribution to provide meaningful insights about the pandemic's progression.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Global trend analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Regional distribution of cases across WHO regions
- Country-wise comparison of key metrics
- Mortality rate analysis by region
- Growth rate and doubling time calculations
- Advanced data visualization
- MySQL integration for robust data storage
